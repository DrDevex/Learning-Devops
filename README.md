## Overview

In this repository, I have gathered a range of bash scripts that demonstrate my understanding of system engineering and DevOps concepts. These scripts cover a variety of topics, including shell scripting fundamentals, automation, server configurations, and more. They are the result of my continuous learning and practical application of these concepts.

## Scripts

1. `script1.sh`: A script that solves a HackerRank problem related to file manipulation.
2. `script2.sh`: An automation script to set up a local development environment.
3. `script3.sh`: A script that performs server monitoring and alerts.

Feel free to explore each script, understand their purpose, and provide any feedback or improvements. Don't hesitate to suggest additional scripts or enhancements to the existing ones!
